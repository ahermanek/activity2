<h2>Get to Know Me!</h2>

<img src="Abby%20Headshot%20Image.jpg" alt="Me!">


<p>My name is <b>Abby Hermanek</b>. I have lived in Nebraska my entire life.
    I have five people in my family, including myself. I have my mom,
    dad, younger brother, and twin sister. When I am not spending time
    with my family you can find me spending time with friends or doing
    some of my hobbies. I enjoy golfing, cooking, and spending time outdoors.
</p>

<p>
    For high school I attended Marian High School. Marian is an all girls,
    private, Catholic high school. There I played on the varsity golf team.
    My senior year our team was State Runner-Up. After graduating I started
    my college education at UNO. I am currently a junior at the University
    of Nebraska - Omaha. I plan on getting my degree in Management Information
    Systems and Accounting.

    Some facts that people may not know about me are that I am a twin and that
    I love anything Disney. Ever since I was born I have been asked the question,
    "What's it like being a twin?" Everywhere I go my sister and I get this question.
    My answer is that I am lucky to be one, I wouldn't have it any other way. Another
    fact some may not know about me is that I love anything Disney. Ever since I was
    a young kid my family has been going to the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida.
    I've been to Disney ten times, you would think it would get old! Every time I go I
    try something new, whether it's a thrill ride or restaurant. Disney never gets old,
    each time we go back we have a different experience. <b>Click <a href = "DisneyParks.html">here</a>

    I have grown up in Nebraska my entire life. I attended grade school at St. Stephen
    the Martyr. Once I graduated from St. Stephens I went to high school at Marian. I
    enjoyed my four years there. At Marian, I was on the golf team, journalism staff,
    and managed the baking club. Now I am attending UNO. I am looking forward to the
    future and what UNO has in store. Go mavs!
