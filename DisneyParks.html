            Disney World is located in Orlando, Florida. This is my
            favorite vacation spot where I enjoy spending time in the Magic Kingdom. On the right,
            there is a picture of Cinderella Castle. This castle is an iconic picture spot that
            draws the attention of those that step foot into the theme park. In this park, there are many classic
            rides that keep guests coming back year after year. The three mountains of the Magic Kingdom is an
            example! Splash, Big Thunder, and Space Mountain are iconic rides made for the entire family!

                My sister, Ally, and I got to ride Flight of Passage for the first time. We had a blast and would ride it
                again when we go back! Guests are willing to wait hours to get this one-of-a-kind experience. Other
                popular attractions here are Expedition Everest: Legend of the Forbidden Mountain, Dinosaur, and Kali
